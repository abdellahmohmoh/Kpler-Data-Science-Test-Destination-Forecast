# Kpler-Data-Science-Test-Destination-Forecast

### The Data

I have three files:

- `vessels.csv`: Contains characteristics of vessels.
- `port_calls.csv`: Contains vessel port visits for 2023.
- `trades.csv`: Contains cargo trading information based on port calls.

### The Tasks

#### Studying the Dataset

I need to explore the dataset to generate insights about patterns in port visits, vessel types, geo-locations, and cargo products. I must check for any abnormalities in the data and provide visual explanations to support my findings. The solution should be reproducible in a Python notebook with all environment requirements and dependencies.

#### Building a Prototype for the Destination Forecast Model

Using the datasets, I need to build a prototype model to predict the next destination of a vessel and the sequence of following ports. The focus is on a solid, well-reasoned approach, rather than model accuracy, and clear code structure.
